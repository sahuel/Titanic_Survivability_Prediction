# Titanic_Survivability_Prediction
This Project is a Machine Learning Model that can predict whether a person would or would not have survived the sinking of the RMS Titanic, depending on their age, gender, Ticket cost, Place of embarkment, among various other parameters.

The Dataset used here has the details of 890 passengers onboard the Titanic who either survived or unfortunately did not, along with their details. We will first study the data and convert it into a usable form through data wrangling, by removing the details we donâ€™t need or that would not affect the learning of the model, then we will impute missing values, scale all of them and then encode the character type values to finally use it to visualise the data and use it after selecting and applying an apt model.
